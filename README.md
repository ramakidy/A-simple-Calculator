The provided code builds a simple calculator using the Tkinter library in Python. Here's a clear explanation of what each part of the code does:

1. **Setting up the GUI**:
   - It creates a window using Tkinter with the title "Simple Calculator".
   - An entry widget is added to display the input and results.

2. **Button Functions**:
   - `button_click(number)`: Appends the clicked number to the input field.
   - `button_clear()`: Clears the input field.
   - `button_add()`, `button_subtract()`, `button_multiply()`, `button_divide()`, `button_modulus()`, `button_power()`, `button_SquareRoot()`: Set the operation and store the first number.
   - `button_equal()`: Performs the selected operation on the stored numbers and displays the result.

3. **Buttons**:
   - Buttons for numbers 0-9, mathematical operations (+, -, *, /), and special operations (% (modulus), x^y (power), âˆš(square root)) are created.
   - Each button is connected to its respective function using the `command` parameter.

4. **Grid Layout**:
   - The buttons are placed in rows and columns using the `.grid()` method.

5. **Main Loop**:
   - `root.mainloop()` is called to display the window and start the event loop.

The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), as well as advanced operations like modulus, exponentiation, and square root. Each operation is triggered by clicking the corresponding button, and the result is displayed in the entry field.

Please note that there are a couple of issues in the code:
- The function names clash with some button names, like `button_add`. It's always a good idea to use distinct names to avoid conflicts.
- The operations for subtraction, multiplication, division, and power are set up, but the UI doesn't have direct buttons for them, like it does for the others.

Overall, this code provides a foundation for a simple calculator and can be expanded upon to add more functionality and improve the user interface.
